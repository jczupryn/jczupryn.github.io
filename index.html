	<h1>Who I Am</h1>
            <hr>
	<h2>Outside of Journalism</h2>
	<p>I am the son of a United States Army Ranger and an oncology nurse practitioner. Because my father was deployed across the world throughout his 20-year career in the military and because my mother followed, I was brought into this world in Gorgas Hospital in Panama City, Panama, in the summer of 1993.</p>

	<p>As I grew, I quickly found my passion in sports. Not only did I love my time playing T-ball, soccer and basketball when I was young, but I also was fascinated just watching the games. My dad, brother and I would spend every Sunday afternoon watching the NFL and spend most of the dog days of summer complaining about the Cubs never winning. Up to this day, sport remains the one thing that can relax me when nothing else can.</p>
	<p>Besides sports, I enjoy spending time in nature. Whether it be spending a week in Yosemite National Park or spending an afternoon in a trail behind my house, I look forward to times in my life where I can enjoy the weather, the scenery and the serenity of nature.</p>
	<h2>As a Journalist</h2>
	<p>I found my calling at Land O Lakes High School during my sophomore year when I enrolled in an elective journalism course. The other students in the class seemed to have no interest in any of the lectures or the opportunities to get published in the Gator Gazette, which was our school newspaper. But from the first day, I was hooked and my teacher could tell. He advised me to actively seek out high school journalism programs like the Poynter Institute Workshops and the Summer Journalism Institute at the University of Florida, both of which I would eventually attend.</p>
	<p>Because of the time my teacher invested in me, I knew journalism would be my course of study after I graduated. And because I spent the majority of my life growing up just two hours south of Gainesville, the University of Florida was the perfect choice for me to pursue my dream.</p>
	<p>In my first semester, I actively sought a sports writing position with the Independent Florida Alligator, which is the unofficial student newspaper of the University of Florida. I got a job with the largest student paper in the country, but I started off small by covering the UF cross country team. As I learned more about the industry and the skills it takes to become a professional journalist, I moved up the ladder by covering the softball team in the spring and the volleyball team for the next two fall semesters. In September 2013, I was promoted to become the newest menâ€™s basketball beat writer.</p>
	<p>It is my dream to keep moving up and cover the UF football team in the fall of 2014. And after I graduate, I want to remain in sports journalism and work as a MLB beat reporter for a national newspaper. I am as excited as ever for my future in the journalism business and I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for me.</p>
